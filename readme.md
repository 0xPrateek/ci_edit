### The ci text editor

The world does need another text editor.

There are other fine curses based editors. I found that I was often trying to
tweak them to get just what I wanted. Almost as often, some dark piece of those
editors prevented that last little bit of customization. So writing a text
editor should allow all the customization I like, right?

Writing a text editor is an interesting project. Give it a try sometime.

This version of ci_edit still doesn't have all the intended features, but it's
a start. It's has the necessary features of a basic text editor and new features
are still being added.

The help I now need is finding out what puts you off; what causes someone who
tries the editor to stop using it. I'm looking to address those issues so that
more users are happy users for a longer time.

Features of ci

- runs on nCurses
  - This means that it can use used in the terminal window just  like vim,
    emacs, and pine.
- cut/copy/paste

    control-v!
- sensible save and quit
  - Using GUI editor keyboard short-cuts: control-s and control-q respectively.
- syntax highlighting
  - keywords an such are displayed in different colors.

  - A source file being edited may start in one grammar such as HTML and
    contain nested JavaScript. ci_edit will highlight each grammar for each
    separate language.
