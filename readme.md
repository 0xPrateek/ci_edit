## The ci text editor

Yes, apparently the world does need another text editor.

Vim and Emacs are both fine editors. I found that I was often trying to tweak
them to get just what I wanted. Almost as often, some dark piece of those
editors prevented that last little bit of customization. At some point it makes
more sense to write something that works as desired rather than continuing to
tweak and customize an existing editor.

This ciEditor still doesn't have all the intended features, but it's a start.
